    <p><span class="bold par">Pixel art was born in the 1970s,</span> albeit very crude in comparison with the digital
        art of today. Because of technological restrictions and the general newness of the field, users were limited to
        the graphics they could create. Some of the earliest pixel art was merely squares and rectangles.</p>

        <span class="bold par">SuperPaint</span> was the precursor to modern graphic programs like Photoshop. Developed
        in 1972 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Shoup_(programmer)" class="external-link">Richard Shoup</a>, it was used by NASA as a way to illustrate its discoveries and data. Its capabilities
        included basic graphics and animation, although its contributions would get cut short. In 1979, the pioneering
        program was put to an end by its development company, Xerox PARC. But that was not before it showed what the
        future could be. It had features like adjustable paintbrushes, image magnification, and the ability to create
        full-color images. Its menu was replicated on subsequent graphics applications like MS Paint and MacPaint.

        <span class="bold par">Though revolutionary at the time,</span> SuperPaint was limited in its capabilities—at
        least what we expect from a graphics program today. As technology continued to advance and computers came with
        better graphics cards and memory, developers and creatives adjusted accordingly. Even with big limitations (by
        today's standards), video games included more detailed graphics and pushed the limits of what was possible.

        The results were iconic characters and graphics that came from the 8-bit era (spanning 1983–1987) and the 16-bit
        era (spanning 1987–1993). If you’re unfamiliar with what 8-bit and 16-bit are, it, in part, refers to the tonal
        variation of the image. An 8-bit picture, for instance, will have fewer amounts of tones available for each
        color than a 16-bit does. The more color tones available, the more detailed that you can get with your
        image-making. Early Mario (the video game character) is an example of 8-bit while Sonic the Hedgehog is an
        example of 16-bit.

        Once Playstation and the N64 game consoles arrived on the market, it was clear that pixel art was waning
        popularity. Through these systems, developers worked on creating 3D models as characters, making side-scrolling
        games feel passé. People wanted the increasingly three-dimensional quality that games like Mario 64 or GoldenEye
        007 could offer.
    </p>

        By the mid-aughts, 3D graphics and gaming had become the norm with pixel art much less common and considered
        retro or vintage.

        <span class="bold par">Nowadays,</span> a pixel art aesthetic is a stylistic choice that artists make. Perhaps
        you'd like to try it, too. Whether you're intrigued by the challenge of working in a blocky style or want to
        give your graphics a retro vibe, you're well on your way to creating pixel art as long as you have a computer
        graphics program. The following tutorials on YouTube will help you learn the basics of creating pixel art.
