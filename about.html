    Hi, my name is Anton.
    In this studying project I'd want to show my skill in CSS, but also I'd want to tell you a bit about Pixel Art
    and its significance in history. This story will not take a long time, but hopefully you'll enjoy it!

    he pixel is an amazing thing. It is how you’re reading the text on this screen right now. It’s a unit of measurement. And for some creative folks, it’s a way to make art. Pixel art is a type of digital art that looks like it was intentionally created with the placement of pixels. Each block is a brushstroke; and, together, the bunches of pixels make a whole piece. In this way, pixel art has a mosaic-like quality to it. Many mosaics create images of tiny squares similar to the blockiness that’s inherent in pixel art.

    In the early days of computers, the hard edges of pixel art were the only type of computer art that you could make. Technology wasn’t advanced enough to create the anti-aliasing that we’re used to now. But as computer graphics continue to become more and more lifelike, pixel art now references a retro style and a callback to those early computer graphics.

    Read on to learn more about pixel art—its history, its waxing and waning in popularity, and how you can make your own.
