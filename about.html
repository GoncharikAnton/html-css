    <h2>Hi, my name is Anton.</h2>

    <span class="bold par">In this studying project</span> I'd want to show my skill in CSS, but also I'd want to tell you a bit about Pixel Art
    and its significance in history. This story will not take a long time, but hopefully you'll enjoy it!

    <h3>The pixel is an amazing thing.</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="bold par">It is how</span> you’re reading the text on this screen right now. It’s a unit of measurement. And for some creative
        folks, it’s a way to make art. Pixel art is a type of digital art that looks like it was intentionally created
        with the placement of pixels. Each block is a brushstroke; and, together, the bunches of pixels make a whole
        piece. In this way, pixel art has a mosaic-like quality to it. Many mosaics create images of tiny squares
        similar to the blockiness that’s inherent in pixel art.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold par">In the early days</span> of computers, the hard edges of pixel art were the only type of computer art that you could
        make. Technology wasn’t advanced enough to create the anti-aliasing that we’re used to now. But as computer
        graphics continue to become more and more lifelike, pixel art now references a retro style and a callback to
        those early computer graphics.
    </p>

        your own.
